    r"""Class for modeling 3D heat transport

    This class solves the 3D advection-diffusion equation for the energy
    density. The energy density factors in both the temperature and the latent
    heat included in meltwater. We use the energy density rather than the
    enthalpy because it comes out to a nice round number (about 500 MPa/m^3)
    in the unit system we use.

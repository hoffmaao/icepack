r"""Functions for calculating the viscosity of a glacier

This module contains procedures for computing the viscosity of a glacier
and, in particular, the viscous part of the action functional for ice flow.
Several flow models all have essentially the same viscous part.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : float, np.ndarray, or UFL expression
        The ice temperature

    This form assumes that we're using the fluidity parameter instead
    the rheology parameter, the temperature, etc. To use a different
    variable, you can implement your own viscosity functional and pass it
    as an argument when initializing model objects to use your functional
    instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u : firedrake.Function
        ice velocity
    h : firedrake.Function
        ice thickness
    A : firedrake.Function
        ice fluidity parameter

    Returns

    "In this demo, we'll revisit the Larsen Ice Shelf.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\dot\\varepsilon = A\\tau^3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "from observational data.\n",
    "In the previous demos, we've come up with some value of the fluidity coefficient and computed a velocity field by solving an elliptic partial differential equation.\n",
    "The fluidity coefficient is roughly a known function of the ice temperature, together with some fudge factors for crystal fabric or large-scale damage, so we know an approximate range of values that it could take.\n",
    "Nonetheless, we don't have large-scale measurements of the fluidity coefficient from remote sensing like we do for ice velocity and thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we can try to come up with a value of $A$ that gives a velocity field closest to what we observed.\n",
    "This idea can be turned into a constrained optimization problem.\n",
    "The quantity we wish to optimize is the misfit between the computed velocity $u$ and the observed velocity $u^o$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(u) = \\frac{1}{2}\\int_\\Omega\\left(\\frac{u - u^o}{\\sigma}\\right)^2dx,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ are the standard deviations of the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "One constraint is that the fluidity field has to be positive.\n",
    "Inequality constraints can require substantially more sophisticated numerical methods.\n",
    "To avoid this problem, we'll cheat our way out by reparameterizing $A$ in terms of a new variable $\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$A = A_0e^{-\\theta/n},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the Glen flow law exponent.\n",
    "No matter the value of $\\theta$, $A$ is always positive.\n",
    "To make this change, we'll give the `IceShelf` object our own custom-made function for calculating the viscous part of the action functional, just like we did for the friction in the last demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to minimizing the misfit, we also want to have a relatively smooth value of the parameter field $\\theta$.\n",
    "The regularization functional $R$ is included to penalize oscillations over a given length scale $L$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R(\\theta) = \\frac{L^2}{2}\\int_\\Omega|\\nabla \\theta|^2dx.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let $F(u, \\theta)$ be the weak form of the shallow shelf equations, again using the new parameter $\\theta$ instead of the fluidity $A$.\n",
    "The physics constraint for our problem is that $F(u, \\theta) = 0$.\n",
    "We can enforce this constraint by introducing the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, in which case the combined objective functional is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$J(u, \\theta; \\lambda) = E(u) + R(\\theta) + \\langle F(u, \\theta), \\lambda\\rangle.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the derivative of this functional with respect to $\\theta$ by using the *adjoint method*.\n",
    "We can then use a descent method to iterate towards a critical point, which is hopefully close to the true value of the fluidity coefficient."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we've shown how to back out the fluidity of an ice shelf from remote sensing observations.\n",
    "We could then use this value, together with a description of how the fluidity evolves, to initialize a prognostic model of the ice shelf.\n",
    "For example, we might assume that the fluidity is a function of ice temperature and damage.\n",
    "The evolution equations for these fields are fairly simple hyperbolic PDE for which we can write solvers using firedrake.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the fluidity that we obtained is not at all spatially homogeneous.\n",
    "Unless we were very clever, we probably couldn't have come up with some way to parameterize it to get a reasonable guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would expect from statistical estimation theory that the value of the misfit functional divided by the shelf area will be around 1.\n",
    "(A sum of squares of normal random variables has a $\\chi^2$ distribution, which has mean 1, there are two components of the velocity vector, and we divide by 2 at the end.)\n",
    "The misfit we obtained once the algorithm has converged is very close to 1, which is a sign that the regularization parameter has been dialed in just right.\n",
    "However, we don't always get so lucky.\n",
    "Sometimes you can't fit the data as well as you expect from statistics, and there are a number of possible \"failure modes\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The error estimates $\\sigma$ could be wrong.\n",
    "2. We don't have a good way to also account for thickness errors, which are substantial.\n",
    "3. We regularized the problem too much.\n",
    "4. The ice shelf becomes grounded on some pinning point and we didn't add basal drag.\n",
    "5. I implemented the numerical optimization algorithm incorrectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Failure modes 1 and 2 happen because we don't have the right statistical distribution for the errors, while failure mode 3 happens because we don't have the right prior distribution.\n",
    "Mode 4 is a more insidious type of failure.\n",
    "In this case, the physics model doesn't actually describe the true behavior of the system, and as a consequence is unable to reproduce the observations with any value of the inputs.\n",
    "Some wrong physics models may nonetheless be able to reproduce the observations, provided that they are [controllable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllability) as a function of the input parameters.\n",
    "Diagnosing this type of failure is arguably the most difficult.\n",
    "Last but not least is human error in implementing the optimization algorithms.\n",
    "These kinds of failures should be caught through testing on synthetic problems."
